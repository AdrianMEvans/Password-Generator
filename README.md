# The Password Factory

## About
**The Password Factory** is a webpage that is designed to generate a password based on user specified criteria.

The user has to choose the following from a range of prompts:

1. Password Length (_must be between 8 and 128 characters_) 
2. What types of characters should the password include:
    * Lower Case Letters
    * Upper Case Letters
    * Numbers
    * Symbols

If the user inputs character length and confirms inlcuded characters then a password will be generated and written to the text area in the page. 

If user length is not within parameters it will not run.

If user does not confirm any character types then it will not run either.
